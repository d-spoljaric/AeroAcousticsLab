# ========== ISA Conditions at 0m =========
T = 288.15 # [K], temperature
p = 101325 # [N/m^2], pressure
rho = 1.225 # [kg/m^3], density
c = np.sqrt(1.4*287.15*T) # [m/s], speed of sound
# =========================================
thrust_total = 2000 # [N]
r_thrust = 0.85 # [-], location of force as a fraction of propeller radius
M_tip = 0.3 # [-], propeller tip Mach number
#M_force = M_tip*r_thrust # [-], Mach number at force location
D = 1 # [m], propeller radius
R_1 = r_thrust*D/2 # [m], magnitude of location of force application vector
B = 4 # [-], number of propeller blades
vel_rad = M_tip*r_thrust*c/R_1 # [rad/s], radial velocity of the location of force application
#blade_offset = 2*np.pi/B # [rad], constant angle offset for each blade of the propeller 
T_blade = thrust_total/B # [N], thrust per blade

# ============================== Chosen Simulation Constants ==================================

F_s = T_blade # Since F is independent of time, the integration is always constant
